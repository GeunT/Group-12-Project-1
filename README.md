Project Proposal: Our project is to uncover patterns and trends in AirBnb and/or Hospitality activity around New York. Weâ€™ll examine relationships and correlations between the cost and location; booked rates and location ; trends in most booked rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.
